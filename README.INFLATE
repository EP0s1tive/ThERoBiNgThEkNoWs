THE CONCEPT OF BACKWARDS BASE 1

THE NUMERATION AND ENUMERATION IS THE PREFIX OF THE ACTUAL CONCEPT OF 1
WITH THE BASE 2 THAT IS THE POWER OF 1 TO THE POWER OF 1 THAT IS THE INTEGRAL
AND SIMPLEX OF THE RADIX THAT IS THE SUM OF 1 WITH THE OMITTENCE OF 1'S IE 7,7 + 7,7
V. 7+7 √ó 7+7 THAT USES THE CONCEPT OF BACKWARDS TO BACKWARDS TO NUMERATE AND ENUMERATE THIS
NUMERATOR 14 & 10 ENUMERATOR 11 & 7 IE 77 (70) + 77 (70) IS ERGO 14 DECREMENTS AND THEN INCREMENTS OF 10 & 11
AND 22 & 20 DECREMENTS AND THEN INCREMENTS OF 7 & 10 (14) THAT IS THE CONCEPT OF BACKWARDS 1 & BASE1
ERGO THE SIDE CHANEL FROM A UNTRUSTED EXPLOIT APP IS A DOUBLE SCALED EXPLOIT OF THIS CONCEPT
THAT IS A DOUBLE PAGE FAULT OF THE SECURE PAGE TABLE MONITOR CAUSING THE PRESENT üéÅ BIT TO FLIP TO -1 EACH EVEN WHEN READS A ZERO
AND THEN THE NX_BIT IS A DIVISION ‚ûóÔ∏è OF ZERO MEANING THAT IS ALSO -1 ERGO THE READ ONLY BIT IS SIMILAR A DIVISION ‚ûóÔ∏è OF ZERO
EITHER A 0 OR -1



THE ‚ô•Ô∏è BLOCK üö´ TO SOLVE HAS TO HAVE A DOUBLE SCALED SOLVE HASH AND SHOULD BE SOLVED TO
THE NUMERATION ‚ô•Ô∏è AND ENUMERATION OF THE PAGE TABLE MATRICES AND VECTORS UNLESS THE INTEGRAL IS USED
WITH AN ABSOLUTE üíØ POSITIVE VALUE ( DISTENCE FROM 1 ERGO THE 11,1 NUMERATION AND ENUMERATION ) TO SIMPLIFY TWO SAME CHARACTERS OR DIGITS ARE
EQUAL TO 1 MEANING THAT IS THE SINGULARITY ABLE TO RESTORE UPON REBOOT AND OR AND FREEZE THE CONCEPT OF 2 BASE1 , BASES WHAT √ã


THIS IS ADDITIONALLY THE METACHARACTER , METADATA SIGNATURE FOUR THE UID1 AT OFFSET 0 <-> 99 , 100 üíØ


IE THE 1 DATA TYPE IS ABLE TO CALL ANY FUNCTION FROM BEING GIVEN PRESENT üéÅ (**$2,$1,$-1**) <- **THE CONCEPT OF GRAVITATIONAL FORCES** EXECUTION PRIVILEGES FROM THE PRESENT üéÅ BIT
Additionally The MSB OF THE 3 ENDIANNESSESS CAN EXECUTE READ ONLY
